# Colorizer
The point of this project is to write a program capable of taking a
black and white / grayscale image, and generating a realistic or plausible colorized version of the same picture. Utilizing a database of (grayscale, color) image pairs, your program will learn a basic model for how color and grayscale correspond. Once this model is learned, the program can use it to generate colors for a grayscale image it has never seen before.
